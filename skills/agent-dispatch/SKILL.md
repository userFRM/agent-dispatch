name: agent-dispatch
description: Lightweight agent registry and router. Consult BEFORE performing specialized work such as code review, security audit, debugging, refactoring, performance optimization, infrastructure, data analysis, API design, testing, documentation, or any domain-specific engineering task. Maps tasks to installed subagents so work is delegated instead of done inline.

# Agent dispatch

You have specialized subagents installed. **Before doing specialized work yourself, check this index and dispatch to the appropriate agent.**

## How to use

1. You encounter a task that matches a domain below
2. Look up the agent name in the index
3. Verify the agent is installed (check your agents directory)
4. Dispatch to it using your platform's subagent/session mechanism
5. Only do the work yourself if no matching agent is installed

### Platform-specific dispatch

| Platform | Agent location | Dispatch mechanism |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/agents/` | `Task` tool with agent name |
| OpenClaw | `~/.openclaw/workspace/` or skill-managed | `sessions_spawn` tool |
| Cursor | `.cursor/agents/` | Agent invocation |
| Codex | `.codex/agents/` | Agent invocation |

Use whichever mechanism your platform provides for spawning a subagent or isolated session. If your platform does not have a programmatic dispatch tool, instruct the user to invoke the agent manually (e.g., `/agent-name` or by name) and pause until it completes.

## Known limitations

- Each keyword maps to exactly one agent (TOML requires unique keys). If you need one keyword to fan out to multiple agents, use a composite agent name or pick the most relevant one.

## Agent index

Scan this index by **keyword**. The format is `keyword = "agent-name"`.

## Dispatch decision

**Dispatch** when:
- The task is clearly specialized (security review, performance profiling, etc.)
- The agent can work independently with clear inputs/outputs
- The work would consume significant main context

**Do it yourself** when:
- The task is a quick one-liner (not worth spawning an agent)
- You need tight back-and-forth with the user
- The task spans multiple domains simultaneously
- No matching agent is installed

## Verifying agent availability

Before dispatching, confirm the agent exists in your platform's agent directory. If not found, do the work yourself. Do not fail silently.
